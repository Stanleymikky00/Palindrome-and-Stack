# Palindrome and Stack (Linked List Implementation)
This project explores the concepts of palindromes and stacks using a linked list implementation in Java. 
It provides a robust approach to checking whether a given word or phrase is a palindrome while 
utilizing a stack data structure for efficient operations.

# Key Features:
Custom Stack Implementation: Uses a singly linked list to build a stack, demonstrating fundamental data 
structure principles.

# Palindrome Checker: 
Determines if a word or phrase reads the same forward and backward using a stack-based approach.

# Efficient Operations: 
Supports essential stack functions such as push, pop, peek, and isEmpty while maintaining 
dynamic memory allocation through linked lists.

# Object-Oriented Design: 
The project follows OOP principles, making the code modular, reusable, and easy to understand.

# Why This Project?
By implementing a stack using a linked list, this project reinforces understanding of data structures and their 
practical applications in solving problems like palindrome detection. It is ideal for students and developers 
interested in algorithm design and memory-efficient programming in Java.
